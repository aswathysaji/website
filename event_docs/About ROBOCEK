Robotics is the branch of technology that deals with the design,
construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer
systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information
processing.The goal of robotics is to design intelligent machines that can
help and assist humans in their day-to-day lives and keep everyone
safe.Robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing
environments. As factories increase their use of robots, the number of
robotics–related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily
rising.Hence it is very necessary to develop ourselves to meet such needs.
Robocek Gcek is a platform developed with the mission to “PROMOTE
ROBOTICS AMONG ENGINEERING STUDENTS”.Robocek was
founded in the year 2012 initially with a small team and a big dream.From
a handful of members and no previous experiences,robocek flew high into
one of the most renowned robotics club in Kerala.Many interesting
activities were proposed and conducted by robocek throughout the
journey.The entry to this family is mainly through Actuator-the beginners
workshop which is conducted for newcomers as an intro to the club.Then
they could start working on their ideas ,learn and teach.Notable activities
were conducted during 2018-19,which included Xplore’19 with 30+
projects,nearly 4 competitions and robotics expo,workshops-Actuator
18,Branding PhotoshopWorkshop etc.Furthur there was various college
level competitions,flood relief activities,Nit calicut visit for Tatva’18 and
so on.Another notable activity was the Avega 2020 ,a robofest with lot of
competitons,workshops,and shows.Robocek members meets from time to
time improving the club,coming up with more and more interesting ideas
with the ultimate aim of development. Robocek not only help people to
engage in robotics but also take them to next level along with their
academic activities . Unfortunately now a days our academics is bound to
be theoretical where robocek of GCEK helps students to understand how
to be an engineer and how does it feels to work out of box.
“Locks are never manufactured without a key.Similarly GOD never gives
problems without solutions”-Robocek is looking forward to makes its
mission more and more successful.
